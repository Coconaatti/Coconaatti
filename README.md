## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Coconaatti/Coconaatti** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a cute game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced python, Java, C
- ❤️ Other stuff I love doing: making friends and ping pong 🏓.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Zebras are actually black with white strips and not vice versa.
